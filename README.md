#dotfiles
This is just a spot for me to upload all of my config files.

The ones here include my i3 config files, my Xdefaults, compton.conf, and a few more.

make sure you have artwiz-fonts, as well as tewi(for the Xresources and powerline), and siji(bitmap icon font) installed.

# instructions

clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/hexadecimal-rainbow/dotfiles.git .dotfiles" (without the quotes, of course) and either copy the config files or create symlinks. whichever you prefer.
Make sure you have airblader's i3-gaps installed, as well as i3blocks.

installing the latest version of rofi is also recommended, though if you prefer you can use dmenu. Just edit the i3/config file if that's the case.

for the lockscreen, make sure you have i3lock, xautolock, scrot, and imagemagick installed, and add the blurlock and lock.png to your home directory as .blurlock and .lock.png (It's the way I've found to work best) (the lockscreen is an edited version of https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy)
