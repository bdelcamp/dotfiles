# dotfiles
This is just a spot for me to upload all of my config files.

The ones here include my i3 config files, my Xdefaults, compton.conf, and a few more.

# instructions

clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/hexadecimal-rainbow/dotfiles.git .dotfiles" (without the quotes, of course) and run symlinks.sh, then edit the files in the repository to your liking.
